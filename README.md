# TrueString

Collection of strings which can be translated into truth values, `true` and `false`.

```rb
"true".truthy?
"false".falsey?
"yes".truthy?
"0".falsey?
"○".truthy?
"❌".falsey?
"はい".truthy?
```

`#truthy?` returns `true` if the string can be interpreted as *true*, and returns `false` if not. `#falsey?` returns `true` if the string can be interpreted as *false*, and returns `false` if not.

An string can not return `true` for both `#truthy?` and `#falsey?`, but may return `false` for both of them.

`Object` also has `truthy?` and `falsey?`.

```rb
Object.truthy?
nil.falsey?
```

The methods returns `true` if the receiver is truthy or falsey respectively.
